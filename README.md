## Hi! Welcome to my website  

I am a researcher working on AI and Machine learning for audio and speech. My current research interests include understanding biases in ML, explainable AI, unsupervised learning and security in voice biometrics.  
I earned my PhD in voice biometrics security from Queen Mary University of London and master's in speech and language processing from University of Sheffield.  
My research publications can be found in my [Google scholar]([https://pages.github.com/](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Ht6H2WgAAAAJ&hl=en)).
